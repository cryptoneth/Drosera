# README: Drosera Network Testnet Setup Script #
## Welcome to the Drosera Network Testnet Setup Script! This script automates the process of setting up and deploying a Trap with two Operators on the Drosera testnet. Follow the steps below to run the script successfully and get your node up and running 

#üìã Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

A VPS/Server:

#OS: Ubuntu (preferably 20.04 or 22.04)

#Specs: At least 2 CPU cores, 4GB RAM, 20GB free disk space

#Internet: Stable connection

#Two Ethereum Holesky Wallets:

Address 1: Used to deploy the Trap.

Address 2: Used as the second Operator.

#Both wallets must have sufficient Holesky ETH. Fund them using a Holesky faucet (e.g., Holesky Faucet).

#Have the private keys (64 hexadecimal characters, no 0x) and public addresses (42 characters with 0x) ready.

#Ethereum Holesky RPC URL:

Get a valid RPC URL from a provider like Alchemy, QuickNode, or use a public node (e.g., https://ethereum-holesky-rpc.publicnode.com).

Example: https://eth-holesky.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key
